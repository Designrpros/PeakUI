# PeakUI Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the PeakUI framework, tracking the journey from prototype to production-grade UI system.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Primaries (Completed ✅)
*Focus: Maturity, genericism, and stability.*

- [x] **Backend Abstraction**: Generic `Backend` trait (wGPU / Glow / TUI).
- [x] **Unified Pipelines**: WASM & Native builds verified and stable.
- [x] **Cupertino Theme**: Glassmorphism and high-fidelity shadow engine.
- [x] **Adaptive Layout**: `NavigationSplitView` with mobile/desktop parity.
- [x] **Neural Vision**: Initial `describe()` semantic node implementation.

## Phase 2: Neural Integration (In Progress 🚧)
*Focus: AI-native execution and structured data routing.*

- [x] **Intelligence Bridge**: OS-wide action relay for AI-to-System communication.
- [x] **PeakDB Router**: Provider-agnostic data scaling (Local / Remote / Swarm).
- [x] **Neural Sudo**: Protective security modifiers for restricted AI actions.
- [x] **Component Labs**: Interactive playgrounds for Buttons and Typography.
- [ ] **State Management**: Implementation of conflict-free replicate data types (CRDTs).

---

## Phase 3: Swarm & Ubiquity (Future 🔮)
*Focus: Peer-to-peer coordination and platform dominance.*

- [ ] **PeakCloud Mesh**: mDNS neighbor discovery and LAN-first synchronization.
- [ ] **P2P Replication**: Highly secure data mirroring via `libp2p`.
- [ ] **Global Semantic Index**: OS-wide vector search powered by PeakDB.
- [ ] **Platform Expansion**: Native iOS/Android bridge and build pipelines.
- [ ] **Enterprise Shell**: Optimization for TV, Spatial, and Kiosk modes.

---

## Phase 4: Universal Ecosystem (Long-term 🌌)
*Focus: Enterprise-grade tooling and sovereign AI.*

- [ ] **Peak SDK**: Automatic AI-readiness via `#[neural_view]` macro.
- [ ] **Private Brain**: On-device LLM execution (Burn/Candle NPU acceleration).
- [ ] **AI Sandboxing**: Isolated WASM runtime for untrusted agent execution.
- [ ] **Pro Tooling**: Visual Layout Inspector and real-time state debugger.
- [ ] **Sovereign Identity**: Decentralized key management and unified protocol.
