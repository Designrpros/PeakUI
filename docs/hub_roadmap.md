# Peak Hub Roadmap

Peak Hub is the dedicated control center for the entire PeakSuite. It acts as the "Command Tower" for your Peak Swarm, allowing you to monitor, manage, and orchestrate every stack across all your devices.

## Phase 1: Pulse & Orchestration (Active 🚧)
*Focus: Centralized monitoring and command relay.*

- [x] **Swarm Pulse**: Real-time heartbeat monitor for all connected nodes.
- [x] **Command Relay**: Unified interface for sending intents to any agent in the mesh.
- [x] **Service Health**: Integrated documentation and live status for all Peak services.
- [x] **Neural Sudo Hub**: A centralized approval center for security-critical AI actions.

## Phase 2: Swarm Topology (Future 🔮)
*Focus: Visualizing and managing the mesh network.*

- [ ] **Mesh Topology**: A live, interactive graph showing device connections and relays.
- [ ] **Path Optimization**: Visual insights into P2P routing and hole punching efficiency.
- [ ] **Resource Analytics**: Swarm-wide CPU/Memory/Storage usage overview.
- [ ] **Node Management**: Remote lifecycle control (Update, Restart, Shutdown) for any node.

---

## Phase 3: Automated Agency (Future 🔮)
*Focus: AI-driven swarm balancing and proactive maintenance.*

- [ ] **Autonomous Delegation**: AI balancing of tasks across the most capable hardware.
- [ ] **Self-Healing Mesh**: Proactive troubleshooting and automatic relay failover.
- [ ] **Global Search**: Unified semantic search across all device indexes.
- [ ] **Performance Baselining**: Automatic detection of swarm-wide performance anomalies.

---

## Phase 4: Universal Control Plane (Long-term 🌌)
*Focus: Infinite scalability and one-click deployment.*

- [ ] **One-Click Deploy**: Deploy the entire Peak stack to new hardware via a single UI button.
- [ ] **Provisioning Engine**: Hardware-agnostic resource allocation.
- [ ] **Global Snapshot**: Roll back the state of your entire swarm to a previous point in time.
- [ ] **PeakLink Protocol**: The ultimate backbone for sovereign, global-scale infrastructure.
